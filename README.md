# 🛡️ Order 66 - Sith Productivity Website

> "Execute Order 66... and focus like a true apprentice of the Dark Side."

A Star Wars-themed, full-stack productivity timer app that transforms your focus sessions into an immersive Sith experience. Built with React, Node.js, and Socket.IO for real-time collaboration.

## 🎯 What is Order 66?
